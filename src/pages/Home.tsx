          Hi, I'm Morris. <br/>
          I'm currently a student at Karlsruhe Institute f√ºr Technologie in Karlsruhe, Germany. Most of my time, I spend studying for exams, playing CTF and tinkering with random tools. <br/>

          When I'm not at the computer, I enjoy playing Basketball, going for a hike in the German Black Forest, or getting back on the computer to play the occasional session of Rust.  <br/>

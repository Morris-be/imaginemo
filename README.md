# Morris BE's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website. If you like the minimalistic design, feel free to take some inspiration. Most importantly, don't forget to throw the baskeball.

Come check out the site at [morrisbe](https://morrisbe.de).

## Setup
First clone the project with `git clone <url>` then, run: 

```
npm install
```
from inside the project directory.

To then run a dev instance:
```
npm run dev
```
